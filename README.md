# [YOUR WEATHER](https://boderg.github.io/your-weather)

- Your weather is a simple weather information page that uses the OpenWeatherMap api.
- Your Weather has been designed so that users worldwide can view the weather not only where they are but also in other countries.
- Your Weather is especially handy for those who travel and wish to know what the weather is like were they are travelling to.
- Your Weather displays the time and date of the area in which your weather search is for.
- Your Weather has a toggle to display the weather in either Celcius or Fahrenheit along with wind speed in Meters per Second or Miles per Hour.
- Your weather has a range of weather details displayed for those that want a little more information than just the temperature and weather description.
- Your Weather is a weather app for everyone.

## Mockup Screenshots

Below are two mockup images of the Your Weather website created using the "Am I Responsive" website.

## UX

- The design for Your Weather was created as a series of wireframes covering mobile, tablet and desktop to determine the initial design and layout of the site.
- The Your Weather site was designed with ease of use and simplicity in mind.
- A simple clean look was built so that all a user needs to do is enter their city or town name and click search.

### Colour Scheme

- The chosen colour scheme for Your Weather is designed to be inviting and have a neutral aesthetic while giving a nice splash of colour.
- The colours used are as follows:-

- `#9ecffa` used for primary text.
- `#9ecffa` used for primary highlights.
- `#fafafa` used for secondary text.
- `#fafafa` used for secondary highlights.
- `#7f0ffb and #c27b6f` combined to create a linear gradient background.
- `#000` used for box shadows and modal background.

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/7f0ffb-c27b6f-9ecffa-fafafa-000000) to generate my colour palette.

![screenshot](documentation/screenshots/Create%20a%20Palette%20-%20Coolors.png)

I have used CSS `:root` variables to easily update the global colour scheme by changing only one value, instead of everywhere in the CSS file.

```css
:root {
  --display-background: linear-gradient(135deg, #7f0ffb, #c27b6f);
  --text-color: #9ecffa;
  --text-hover-color: #fafafa;
  --box-shadow-color: #000;
  --drop-shadow-color: #9ecffa;
  --modal-background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);
}
```

### Typography

- I used the Google Font called 'Play' for the Your Weather site.
- I felt that this font had a nice modern style that is easy to read and that it fitted well with the Your Weather site.

- [Play](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Play) was used for all text within the site.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used in the Your Weather site, for GitHub links in the footer and modal and for the search icon in the main weather card.

## Wireframes

ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘

In this section, display your wireframe screenshots using a Markdown `table`.
Instructions on how to do Markdown `tables` start on line #213 on this site: https://pandao.github.io/editor.md/en.html

Alternatively, dropdowns are a way to condense several wireframes into a collapsible menu to save space.
Dropdowns in Markdown are considered some of the only acceptable HTML components that are allowed for assessment purposes.

**IMPORTANT**! **IMPORTANT**! **IMPORTANT**!
The example below uses the `details` and `summary` code elements.
However, for these scripts to work, I've had to add spaces within the `< >` elements.

You MUST remove these spaces for it to work properly on your own README/TESTING files.
Remove the spaces within the `< >` brackets for the `details` and `summary` code elements,
for the Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop wireframes.

To follow best practice, wireframes were developed for mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes.
I've used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes) to design my site wireframes.

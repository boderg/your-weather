### Typography

- Two fonts were chosen from Google fonts as follows.

- [Concert One](https://fonts.google.com/?query=concert+one) was used for the primary headers, titles and general text.
This font was chosen for it's bold and rounded aesthetic.

- [Shadows Into Light](https://fonts.google.com/?query=shadows) was used for all menu text and text entry fields.
This font was chosen for it's hand written aesthetic that I wanted to use for the menu items, portraying a hand written menu.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, specifically as the social media and copyright icons in the footer.
